# Project 07

## Problem definition

Thanks to Docker, it's really easy to test and deploy websites. You just need a web server and a language interpreter inside the container, along with a volume to host the website's files.

In this project, you're required to build the image that satisfies the described scenario, being Apache and PHP the selected software packages. Also add an `index.php` file calling the `phpinfo()` function as the main entrypoint of the webserver.

## Deliverables

A Dockerfile and an index.php file.
