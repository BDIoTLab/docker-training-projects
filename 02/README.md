# Project 02

## Problem definition

Following best practices guidelines, the previous project should be divided in, at least, two containers, one for the webserver and one for the database.

Therefore, your task is to deploy Wordpress and MySQL in two containers, preferrably using official images. Build a shell script (`run.sh`) for this, so both containers are running and Worpress is accessible from a web browser at http://localhost:8002.

## Deliverables

A shell script that manages the whole process.
