# Project 01

## Problem definition

We have a container which is built and run with a shell script (`run.sh`). This container deploys a complete Wordpress installation, including a MySQL instance. However, the process fails when building the image.

Find and fix the issue, so the container is run and Worpress is accessible from a web browser at http://localhost:8001.

## Deliverables

A fixed Dockerfile.
