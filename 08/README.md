# Project 08

## Problem definition

Python development and testing is eased when we introduce Docker in our toolset. That way, we can launch a container with our latest changes to code, run the Python interpreter and test the app.

In this project, you're required to build a Docker image that runs a simple Flask app. Use the provided `app.py` and `requirements.txt` files. The app requires Python 3.6+.

Test the app by making a GET request to http://localhost:5000/. You should receive `Hello World` as answer.


## Deliverables

A Dockerfile.
