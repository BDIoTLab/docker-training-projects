# Project 04

## Problem definition

Magento 2 is one of the most popular and featureful FOSS e-commerce platforms, but that comes at a price: it's installation and management is quite complex. Therefore, it's a good idea to have a containerized instance of Magento 2 when developing and testing it.

Build a shell script to deploy a working container of the latest version of Magento 2, accessible from a web browser at http://localhost, and another container for the database (use the official MySQL image).

## Deriverables

A shell script, a Dockerfile for Magento and any auxiliar file you may need.
