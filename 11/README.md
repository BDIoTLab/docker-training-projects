# Project 11

## Problem definition

In this project, you're required to build a multistage Docker image that first compiles the provided Golang source code (example taken from https://hackernoon.com/how-to-create-a-web-server-in-go-a064277287c9) and then builds an image that runs the resulting executable, which opens a web server at port 8080.

## Deliverables

A Dockerfile.
